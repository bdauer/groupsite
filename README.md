## About

This project helped to familiarize me with AWS ElasticBeanstalk and AWS RDS, and gave me more experience with Django. I wanted to get it out quickly. This means that in terms of the visual appeal there is a lot lacking. For example, I used class-based views where it would have been better to override them in order to take advantage of bootstrap. Nevertheless, once finished, it should be functional in the following:

- Oauth2 Registration with Facebook and Google.
- Hosted on elastic beanstalk with RDS using MySQL.
- Profile page with avatar.
- Set up groups. Invite other site members to your group.
- Accept or decline invites.
- View pending invites, sent and received.
- See all groups one has created or is a member of, maintain some admin privileges over groups one has created.
